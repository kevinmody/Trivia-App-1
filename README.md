# Triviana!

## Description:

Triviana is a timed, multiple-choice trivia game. It generates a chosen number of random questions using a trivia API and populates fake answers using Wikidata. The user's time and correct answer total are logged to be shared on a leaderboard. The user can also create an account in order to keep track of their quiz statistics.

## Feature: 

- Leaderboard: This feature is a global leaderboard where users are ranked based on their performance in Trivia game.
